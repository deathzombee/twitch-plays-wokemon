Project #1: Building your own "Twitch Plays Pokemon" using Golang

Task #1: Write a Go program from scratch that reads a local file, then performs keyboard inputs as described in that file.
Possible framework to help out with sending key board events: https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo
Make a public github repo, then doing all of your developing on a branch named week1
Try to use the keyboard inputs to open a text editor, and then type in it
Task #2: Write a Go program from scratch that scrapes twitch chat continuously, filters for messages with zero emotes, and prints those messages to stdout

We'll review what you've got next Friday. Make sure you've got Go running and working on your machine. Unit tests are a plus!

Week 2:
- Unit tests for intepretron
- MyRobot class 
  - Wraps robotgo
  - Has 'setup' method that fouses on target process
  - acceptcommand method
  - teardown method?
- fmt linter for sublime?
- Constructor for Interpretron class and another attribute for dictionary, ability to pass in own dictionary (for example, different systems/games)
